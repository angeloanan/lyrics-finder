# Privacy Policy

Christopher Angelo ("**I**" or "**My**") built the Lyrics Finder bot ("**Bot**" or "**Service**") as an Open Source bot. The Service is provided by my self at no cost and is intended for use as is.

If you choose to use the bot, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Usage

I collect search queries and response time done through the bot. This includes the *Now Playing* and the *Auto Search* command.

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies or individuals due to the following reasons:

To host the Bot;
To perform Bot-related services; or
To assist me in analyzing on how is the bot being used.

I want to inform users of the bot that these third parties technically have access to your [Personal Information](#information-collection-and-usage) but they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. They must only perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf.

## Security

I take security very seriously and am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Discord does not allow anyone under the age of 13 or is under the [the minimum age of digital consent in one's country](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612) to use the app. If you have any concerns about this, please instead contact Discord Trust & Safety team at https://dis.gd/request

## Data Retention

I collect these for ~30 days which will then be automatically deleted. These data are stored at my home computer located in Indonesia. The data may persist in copies made for backup for additional time.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. You can also find out the last time where the privacy policy was updated through the Bot's "privacypolicy" command.

I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

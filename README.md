## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Lyrics Finder is a Discord bot which searches for Lyrics on Genius. It supports all song language, as long as it's listed on Genius. If you don't know the song title, you can search the song by using its lyrics.

If you display your current Spotify song as your Discord status, it can automatically search the song by using a command. Feeling like singing to your song? There's also a mode to search every song you're playing on Spotify.

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot uses the [Genius API](https://genius.com/developers) to search the lyrics of a song. When searching using Spotify, the bot grabs the User presence and forms the search query by `<Song Title> <Song Artist>`, otherwise using the user's input.

After fetching the Genius API, it takes the first search result and scrape the lyrics page. This is complicated since Genius doesn't give the lyrics using their API and scraping the page tends to be very inconsistent.

The scrape result gets feed into a Regex filter, which then gets feed into a function, forming the Discord Embed fields.

The entire bot is written using [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) with [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org) as the framework
